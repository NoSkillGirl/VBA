In this project i tried to simulate a shopping cart thinking that the shopkeeper is valuing the shopping cart based on customer items. The Total value of the cart is auto calculated based on the items and their quantities. 

Flow goes like this:
1. Customer comes to the shopkeeper with a cart of items
2. Shopkeeper takes each item, select the item and its quantity in the excel.
3. Shopkeeper can instantly respond to customer queries like
    - what is the MRP of the item?
    - What is the discount applied for the item?
    - What is the selling price?
    - What is the cart value?
