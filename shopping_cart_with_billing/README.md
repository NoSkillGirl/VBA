In this project i tried to simulate a shopping cart thinking that the shopkeeper is valuing the shopping cart based on customer items. The Total value of the cart is auto calculated based on the  items and their quantities.

If customer want to choose payment option as EMI, shopkeeper can select the EMI period and bank according to customer comfort and tell customer his monthly EMI amount and total EMI amount.

 Flow goes like this:
 1. Customer comes to the shopkeeper with a cart of items
 2. Shopkeeper takes each item, select the item and its quantity in the excel.
 3. Shopkeeper can instantly respond to customer queries like
     - what is the MRP of the item?
     - What is the discount applied for the item?
     - What is the selling price?
     - What is the cart value?
     - What is the interest percentage for bank choosen by customer?
     - What is the monthly EMI amount customer need to pay?
     - What is the total amount customer need to pay (for EMI option)?
